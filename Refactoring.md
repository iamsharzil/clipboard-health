# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

> In the process of refactoring, several choices were made to improve the readability and flexibility of the deterministicPartitionKey function:

1. The use of early returns and conditional checks reduces nesting, making the code flow more straightforward.
2. The extraction of repetitive logic into a separate `generateHash` function enhances modularity and adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
3. `generateHash` function takes care of stringifying the data and thus eliminates redundant stringification calls.
4. `generateHash` function is also made flexible in order to take different algorithms and encoding methodings to generate an hash.
5. A separate constants file is created to keep fixed data to avoid allocating memory repeatedly for the same variables such as: `TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY,MAX_PARTITION_KEY_LENGTH`

The updated version of the code improves readability by reducing complexity and redundancy, making the code easier to understand and maintain. By employing modularization, clear naming conventions, and improved code structure, the refactored version provides a cleaner and more comprehensible solution.
